Overall: B- for now, deferred for your reply!
 
It looks like you've done a good amount of work and you did not integrate it well yet. 
I am not sure what all your .txt files are for. 
I opened them to be surprized they are all grammar files.
Which one do you want me to read?
Did you switch to implementing Mini?

makefile.txt:
You have a makefile that is built around Mini.g, however, there is
no Mini.g in your code. Did you forget checking that in? 
All the .txt files do not look like they are implementing Mini. 
Anyway, your rules should be general and not specific to few .c/cpp files. I am not sure the rule at line 8 gives you what you want. 
What if I edited a .c file and included a new header? I have to go and edit the makefile for that also? Check how to generate automatic 
dependencies in the make slides. 



graph.h
good work here. separate your implementation from your header files and move your function implementation to a .cpp file. 
not a good choice of variable names especially when you pass nam to set name. Did you know you can pass name and use this->name = name;
think again of your copy function. it is cumbersome to use an array to do this especially that you are not deleting the array when you are done!
What do you want to do on line 186?

line 195: check the find algorithm in stl.

GRLIST.h
There is another class here called Graph. Which one are you using?

I will wait for your feedback to complete my comments.
