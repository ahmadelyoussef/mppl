For the testing :
The main directory should contain :
	- antlr3c.dll
	-input.txt ( The input to be parsed)
	- libantlr3c-3.2-win
	-antlr-3.2.jar
	-LLIST.h
	-LINK.h
	-GRLIST.h
	-main.c
	-Mini.g
	-makefile

-The first version is just for the expression parsing .
For example putting the following expression : 2*3 + 4*6 + 5 will print the graph as : 
* 2 3
* 4 6
+ * * 5
